\section{Affordances}

Affordance is request, demand, allow, encourage, discourage, refuse.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Real affordances:} functions attached to a given object---what, potentially, that object affords
    \item \textbf{Percieved affordances:} feature that are clear to the user
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Mechanism and Conditions Framework}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Mechanism: Technology
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{(request, demand)} initiated by object
        \item \textbf{(encourage, discourage, refuse)} responses to subject inclination
        \item \textbf{(allow)} could be initialted by subject or object
    \end{itemize} 
    \item Conditions: People interacting with technology
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Perceive a range of functions
        \item Having varying skills in operating/interacting (dexterity)
        \item Different level of support due to cultural norms, intelectual regulations.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Central Claims of STS Theories}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Technological Momentum}: Individuals and groups direct the development of new technologies, but investment in large socio-technical systems makes them difficult to change
    \item \textit{Technological Determinism}: the idea that technology develops as the sole result of an internal dynamic, and then, unmediated by any other influence, molds society to fit its patterns
    \item \textit{Social Construction of Technology}: What matters is not technology itself, but the social or economic system in which it is embedded. This maxim, which in a number of variations is the central premise of a theory that can be called the social determination of technology, has an obvious wisdom.
    \item \textit{Actor Network Theory}: 
\end{itemize}
\section{Actor Network Theory (ANT)}
\subsection{Why?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item To analyze sociotechnical systems, in particular organization and power.
    \item More rigorous ways to analyze ever-shifting nature of technology.
    \item ANT attempts to improve \textit{Technological Determinism}, \textit{Technological Momentum} and \textit{Social Construction of Technology} by treating technological and social actors as relational.
    \item Allows us to map affordances.
\end{itemize}

Political: arrangements of power and authhority in human association as well as a system

\subsection{Types of Actors in ANT}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Human actors:
    \item Conceptual actors:
    \item Artifact actors:
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Power}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Neutral: depending on how it is used.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Originally concentrated in large structures like government or coorperation
        \item Modern sense of power is a component of all relationships between different actors
        \item \textbf{Power is always faced with resistance}
        \item ANT can be used to identify sources of power and suggest ways to dismantle power   
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Example---Federal Election}

It is helpful to start with one actor and establish relations with other actors.
